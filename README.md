## Motivation

We created this application in order to spread awareness of mental health, especially in the University community. As college students, we have struggled and seen our friends struggle through trying times, and having the awareness of how to deal with or stay informed about those situations is important to not just us but all of us. 

## How

We used Xcode 12 and Swift 5 using UIKit in order to accomplish our goal. We also plan to use Core Data for the Quiz components when those will be finished. 

## What's Next

We seek to complete this project in the near future when time permits.
